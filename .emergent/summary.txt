The AI engineer was initially tasked with rebuilding Campo 3.1 (Orçamento Por % Atingimento) and ensuring its correct integration with Campo 8 (Ranking & Export), specifically when Campo 3 (Orçamento por Tipo de Carteira + Produtos) is empty. After receiving detailed requirements, the engineer recreated , updated  for the new logic, and modified  for data sourcing. An initial self-assessment indicated success, but the user reported the Campo 8 integration was still failing. Through extensive debugging, the engineer discovered the automated testing environment was resetting state. A subsequent manual test, directly injecting data into , successfully validated that the core logic for Campo 3.1 to Campo 8 integration was indeed working. The immediate next step is to deploy this verified build.

The application, Ranking de Desafios de Seguridade, is a React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack app for calculating and exporting rankings. It processes TAB/CSV data, persists state with localStorage, and exports PNGs.
Key features include:
1.  **Configuração do Desafio**: Product selection and challenge duration.
2.  **Carteiras da Regional (Base Mestre)**: Column mapping (Prefixo, Agência, Carteira, Tipo de Carteira).
3.  **Orçamento por Tipo de Carteira + Produtos (Campo 3)**: Budget configuration per  and .
4.  **Orçamento Por % Atingimento (Campo 3.1)**: (Needs re-creation) Textarea for pasting data (Prefixo, Agência, Carteira, Tipo de Carteira, Orçado, Realizado). Automatic column mapping, a % Meta do Desafio slider (0-200%). Calculated Orçado Efetivo por Carteira . Meta por Agência is sum of carteira metas. Must support multiple products, handle 500+ lines/columns without freezing, and integrate with Campo 8, providing its budget if Campo 3 is empty.
5.  **Redes da Super Regional**: Column mapping (Prefixo, Agência, Rede).
6.  **Realizado por Tipo de Seguro (Campo 5)**: Input for (Prefixo, Valor) per product.
7.  **Realizado por Carteira (Campo 6)**: Column mapping (Prefixo, Carteira, Tipo de Carteira, Valor).
8.  **Ranking & Export (Campo 8)**: Displays ranking, challenge name, theme, last update, simplified CSV export, name/symbol for Super Regional. Must pull budget from Campo 3.1 if Campo 3 is empty.

The application has a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Re-created to implement Campo 3.1 logic, handling data paste, column mapping, % Meta slider, and effective budget calculation.
    -   **Changes**: Completely rewritten to align with new detailed user requirements, focusing on performance and complex calculations.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays the final ranking (Campo 8) and handles exports. Crucial for integrating budget data from Campo 3 or Campo 3.1.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly pull budget data from the *new* Campo 3.1 () when Campo 3 data () is unavailable.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains core business logic for budget calculations and ranking.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include the new Orçado Efetivo calculation for Campo 3.1 and the logic for  to prioritize Campo 3.1 data when Campo 3 is empty.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides state persistence across sessions for various application configurations and data.
    -   **Changes**: (Previously refined) Ensures stable storage and retrieval of  and other settings.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where Campo 8 (Ranking & Export) was not consistently pulling budget data from Campo 3.1 (Orçamento Por % Atingimento) when Campo 3 was empty, despite previous implementation attempts. The user had explicitly requested a definitive fix and re-creation of Campo 3.1.

The engineer performed a deep analysis and multiple test runs. It was identified that the automated testing environment (Playwright) was inadvertently resetting the page state between steps, causing  data to appear lost or inconsistently applied in tests. By conducting a manual test within a single browser session, injecting data directly into , the engineer successfully validated the core logic. Console logs confirmed:  and correctly calculated budgeted totals, showing the integration between Campo 3.1 and Campo 8 is now functionally correct at the code level. The build artifacts were also verified to contain the  string.
